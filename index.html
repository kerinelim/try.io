<h1> Bedok Reservoir Park</h1>

<p> <font size="3" face="verdana" color="black"> Bedok Reservoir Park - A popular place for fun and activities in Singapore, but slowly being avoided and forgotten by Singaporeans. This is due to the rising suicide cases in 2011 and 2012. It has since then became an infamous location. Over the years, with the upgradings and renovations done, Bedok Reservoir Park can be a good location for many. From joggers, to adrenaline junkies, to water sports enthusiasts, it is a all-in-one location to relax your mind.  </p>
